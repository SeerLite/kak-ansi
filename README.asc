kak-ansi
========

Kakoune support for rendering ANSI-colored text.

== Installing

You'll need a C99-compatible C compiler.  The Kakoune plugin will build the
filter program automatically if it's not already built on load.  If you want
to build it manually instead:

[source,sh]
----
$ make
----

== Usage

This plugin provides `ansi-render`, `ansi-render-selection`, and `ansi-clear`
commands.  In addition, when Kakoune is used as a pager, it will configure
the `*stdin*` buffer to process escape codes when idle.

*ansi-render*::
    Removes ANSI escapes from the buffer and adds highlighting for regions
    that were ANSI-colored.
*ansi-render-selection*::
    Removes ANSI escapes from selections and adds highlighting for regions
    that were ANSI-colored.
*ansi-clear*::
    Clear highlighting added by the previous two commands.

== Contributing

New features and bug fixes should have test coverage in `tests/tests.bash`
where possible.  Tests can be run with a modern bash:

----
$ bash tests/tests.bash
