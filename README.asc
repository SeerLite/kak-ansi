kak-ansi
========

Kakoune support for rendering ANSI-colored text.

== Installing

You'll need a C99-compatible C compiler.  The Kakoune plugin will build the
filter program automatically if it's not already built on load.  If you want
to build it manually instead:

[source,sh]
----
$ ${CC-c99} -o kak-ansi-filter kak-ansi-filter.c
----

== Usage

This plugin provides `ansi-render`, `ansi-render-selection`, and `ansi-clear`
commands, all which have online help.  In addition, when Kakoune is used as a
pager, it will configure the `*stdin*` buffer to process escape codes when
idle.

== Contributing

New features and bug fixes should have test coverage in `tests/tests.bash`
where possible.  Tests can be run with a modern bash:

----
$ bash tests/tests.bash
----
